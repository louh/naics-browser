naics-browser
=============

[more info](https://github.com/codeforamerica/naics-api)

this is a front-end application to the [NAICS API](http://naics.codeforamerica.org/)
from Code for America that i keep rebuilding every once in a while because it
allows me to test things in a narrowly scoped application. although it looks
pretty snazzy please keep in mind that in an ideal world someone would have
tried to do some actual user research to determine whether the official NAICS
website needs an overhaul and if so, how best to do it. this just re-implements
a pretty straightforward look-up UI but does not answer any usability questions.
